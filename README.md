## ⛅ Weather Forecast Dashboard ⛅

## Technologies used and why.

For this project, I needed to create a application that the use can choose a city around the world and check how is the temperature for today and next 5 days at that place.
During this project I had been trough challenges as searching online for the JavaScript functions and how to use them in order to have the best outcome. Using HTML and CSS interface, the power from JavaScript will give the function to the page. Also using the power of Jquery and Bootstrap to have a better view and performance for the website. Pulling APIs is a great tool to use the large amount of data for this project.

## Challenges for future improvement

A good thing to improve for future is to implement a way to compare with other cities around the world, for example, compare the temperature for Toronto and Vancouver. Also another great improvement would be adding the option to choose how long you want to check the forecast information, 5 days, 14 days, 1 month.

## The Project

This challenge consists in creating a weather dashboard to check today and next 5 days information:

- When open the main page, user will be able to search after input a city name
- When click search icon, will be presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
- Looking for the information for that city, user can see an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
- Also user will be able to see a 5-day forecast that displays the date, conditions, temperature, wind speed and the humidity
- Click on the city in the search history will present again that city information
