## ⛅ Weather Forecast Dashboard ⛅

## Technologies used and why.

For this project, I needed to create a application that the use can choose a city around the world and check how is the temperature for today and next 5 days at that place.
During this project I had been trough challenges as searching online for the JavaScript functions and how to use them in order to have the best outcome. Using HTML and CSS interface, the power from JavaScript will give the function to the page. Also using the power of Jquery and Bootstrap to have a better view and performance for the website. Pulling APIs is a great tool to use the large amount of data for this project.

## Challenges for future improvement

A good thing to improve for future is to implement a way to compare with other cities around the world, for example, compare the temperature for Toronto and Vancouver. Also another great improvement would be adding the option to choose how long you want to check the forecast information, 5 days, 14 days, 1 month.

## The Project

This challenge consists in creating a weather dashboard to check today and next 5 days information:
